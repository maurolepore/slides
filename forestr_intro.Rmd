```{r removeSlideNumbers, include=FALSE}
# From https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/issues/244
# To remove slide numbers to one of two things:

# One: Place this under the yamal header of the .Rmd file

# <style type="text/css">
# slides > slide:not(.nobackground):after {
#   content: '';
# }
# </style>



# Or, two: Place this in a separate mystyle.css file (remove <style> tag)

# slides > slide:not(.nobackground):after {
#   content: '';
# }

# For approach two, the yamal header should look like this:
# ---
# output:
#   ioslides_presentation:
    # css: mystyles.css
# ---
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# knitr ----
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  comment = "#>",
  collapse = TRUE,
  # fig.align = "center",
  fig.asp = 0.618,
  fig.width = 6,
  out.width = "100%",
  cache = TRUE,
  echo = FALSE 
  )
# If you want to make sure the font size is consistent across all your figures,
# whenever you set out.width, you’ll also need to adjust fig.width to maintain
# the same ratio with your default out.width. For example, if your default
# fig.width is 6 and out.width is 0.7, when you set out.width = "50%" you’ll
# need to set fig.width to 4.3 (6 * 0.5 / 0.7).

<div class="notes">

A lot of your effort is duplicated. For example, more than once person in this room may have written code that other person needs.

We need a place where software problems can meet software solutions.

I'll talk about

- github

- forestr

ASK

- Who uses GitHub?
- Who uses the CTFS-R package?

</div>




## Outline

What do we need and what we have?

Where are we heading?

How can you contribute?











# What do we need?

- We need GitHub

- We need to improve CTFS R Package


## Why we need better software infrastructure and tools?

```{r, out.width="45%", fig.show='hold'}
knitr::include_graphics("behavioural_architect_bad.jpg")
knitr::include_graphics("behavioural_architect_good.jpg")
```

[Behaviour design](http://www.nirandfar.com/); [Focus on systems](http://jamesclear.com/goals-systems).

## Why we need better software infrastructure and tools? | Is your system error prone?

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("error.png")
```

## Fall effortlessly into the pit of success 

```{r, out.width="70%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("pit.jpg")
```

## Reuse good code ([tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/) dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2)

## Make your reaserch reproducible (e.g. with R, rmarkdown, GitHub)


## Share your work

(R for Data Science)



## GitHub is one useful solution

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("dogit.png")
```

## What changed? When? Why? Who changed it?

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("github_what.png")
```

## Can we discuss this change?

```{r, out.width="95%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("metadata.png")
```

# What do we have?




# Where are we heading?

Set priorities

- tell me what you actually use

improve what we have

- documentation
- tests
- tutorials
- refactor

add what you have

create what we lack


















where we are heading

- we need better documentation
- more tests
- list priorities
- new code

how to contribute



title and contact details

- twitter maurolepore
- github forestgeo



engage audience with questions

- who uses github
    - how many people know about the CTFS R package
    - how many people use the CTFS R package



idea: the pit of success. the field guide to human error


why listen? show some bits of progress so people get excited.

- I'm here to help. What my job is?

# What I ask | How can you contribute?




what I  am asking people to do

contribute
   - re-write documentation
   - tell me your issues
   - tell me your interests
   - review material
   - contribute code
   - what would you like to leran

- ask

    - 
    - what they want to hear about?
        - what functions they use
        - what problems they find
    - meeting session to discuss ideas
        - code to contribute
        - workshops
