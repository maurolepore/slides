```{r removeSlideNumbers, include=FALSE}
# From https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/issues/244
# To remove slide numbers to one of two things:

# One: Place this under the yamal header of the .Rmd file

# <style type="text/css">
# slides > slide:not(.nobackground):after {
#   content: '';
# }
# </style>



# Or, two: Place this in a separate mystyle.css file (remove <style> tag)

# slides > slide:not(.nobackground):after {
#   content: '';
# }

# For approach two, the yamal header should look like this:
# ---
# output:
#   ioslides_presentation:
    # css: mystyles.css
# ---
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  comment = "#>",
  collapse = TRUE,
  # fig.align = "center",
  fig.asp = 0.618,
  fig.width = 6,
  out.width = "100%",
  cache = TRUE,
  echo = FALSE 
  )
# If you want to make sure the font size is consistent across all your figures,
# whenever you set out.width, you’ll also need to adjust fig.width to maintain
# the same ratio with your default out.width. For example, if your default
# fig.width is 6 and out.width is 0.7, when you set out.width = "50%" you’ll
# need to set fig.width to 4.3 (6 * 0.5 / 0.7).

# Good-Code Reuse with GitHub & R | Update & How You Can Contribute

### __\@mauro_lepore__

<div class="notes">

If you reuse good code you can be more productive.

GitHub and R packages can help you do that.

</div>



## Overview

__My goal: to learn how I can help you__

- Show progress and outline future direction

- Show how you can contribute

- Discussion focused on the why and what, not how

- Mechanics via listed resources or see me later



## Do you use the CTFS R package? What functions?



# Update | forestgeo & forestr



## A good system lets you fail safely

```{r error-field-guide}
knitr::include_graphics("error.png")
```



## Fast failure means fast feedback

```{r fail-safely}
knitr::include_graphics("fail.png")
```



## You should fall effortlessly into the pit of success

```{r fall-in-pit-of-success, out.width="70%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("pit.jpg")
```


# GitHub | github.com/forestgeo

### [Why?](https://goo.gl/PRtpmZ) & [How?](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html)



## You may have a good system already

```{r projects-how-we-manage}
knitr::include_graphics("framework.png")
```



## Real projects are complex | Is there a better system?

```{r projects-not-linear}
knitr::include_graphics("branch.png")
```

## Data and metadata stay synchronized

```{r discuss-change, out.width="95%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("metadata.png")
```
