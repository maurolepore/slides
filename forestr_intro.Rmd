```{r removeSlideNumbers, include=FALSE}
# From https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/issues/244
# To remove slide numbers to one of two things:

# One: Place this under the yamal header of the .Rmd file

# <style type="text/css">
# slides > slide:not(.nobackground):after {
#   content: '';
# }
# </style>



# Or, two: Place this in a separate mystyle.css file (remove <style> tag)

# slides > slide:not(.nobackground):after {
#   content: '';
# }

# For approach two, the yamal header should look like this:
# ---
# output:
#   ioslides_presentation:
    # css: mystyles.css
# ---
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# knitr ----
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  comment = "#>",
  collapse = TRUE,
  # fig.align = "center",
  fig.asp = 0.618,
  fig.width = 6,
  out.width = "100%",
  cache = TRUE,
  echo = FALSE 
  )
# If you want to make sure the font size is consistent across all your figures,
# whenever you set out.width, you’ll also need to adjust fig.width to maintain
# the same ratio with your default out.width. For example, if your default
# fig.width is 6 and out.width is 0.7, when you set out.width = "50%" you’ll
# need to set fig.width to 4.3 (6 * 0.5 / 0.7).

- github and rpackages help reproduce  research
- should let us reach your research goals faster
- if you contribute the ball rolls faster and  you get citations, the challenge is not to get published but to be cited.

## Is most research actually reproducible? Why?

## Improving the quality of our code and our productivity

### _The single biggest way to improve both the quality of your code and your productivity is to reuse good code._

# What do we need and what we have?



## What our good code needs?

A place to live and evolve collaboratively_

- Code repository and forum: GitHub

A structure that makes using  the code easy

- R packages: __forestr__ and friends



## GitHub

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("ghpkg.png")
```



## How do you manage your projects?

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("framework.png")
```

[Git for Humans](https://speakerdeck.com/alicebartlett/git-for-humans), Alice Bartlett. This gets messy and suggest that projects evolve linearly, which is false.

What are research projects like?

- complex, 

- involve multiple collaborators,

- variable.

What changes? -> What do you need?

- the data and meta-data -> to track changes/versions;

- access privilege -> to control the level of access that people have

</div>



# GitHub is one useful solution

Set priorities

- tell me what you actually use

improve what we have

- documentation
- tests
- tutorials
- refactor

add what you have

create what we lack


















where we are heading

- we need better documentation
- more tests
- list priorities
- new code

how to contribute



title and contact details

- twitter maurolepore

# What I ask | How can you contribute?




what I  am asking people to do

contribute
   - re-write documentation
   - tell me your issues
   - tell me your interests
   - review material
   - contribute code
   - what would you like to leran

- ask

    - 
    - what they want to hear about?
        - what functions they use
        - what problems they find
    - meeting session to discuss ideas
        - code to contribute
        - workshops





# What else?



# Show

- ttt as an example of contribution by a researcher. How a script was transformed into a function, a website, a vignette
- how to file an issue, e.g. report a problem
- how to file a pull request, e.g. edit documentation
