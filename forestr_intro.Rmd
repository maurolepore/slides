```{r removeSlideNumbers, include=FALSE}
# From https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/issues/244
# To remove slide numbers to one of two things:

# One: Place this under the yamal header of the .Rmd file

# <style type="text/css">
# slides > slide:not(.nobackground):after {
#   content: '';
# }
# </style>



# Or, two: Place this in a separate mystyle.css file (remove <style> tag)

# slides > slide:not(.nobackground):after {
#   content: '';
# }

# For approach two, the yamal header should look like this:
# ---
# output:
#   ioslides_presentation:
    # css: mystyles.css

  fig.width = 6,
  out.width = "100%",
  cache = TRUE,
  echo = FALSE 
  )
# If you want to make sure the font size is consistent across all your figures,
# whenever you set out.width, you’ll also need to adjust fig.width to maintain
# the same ratio with your default out.width. For example, if your default
# fig.width is 6 and out.width is 0.7, when you set out.width = "50%" you’ll
# need to set fig.width to 4.3 (6 * 0.5 / 0.7).

# Reuse Good Code with GitHub & R

### __\#forestgeo__

<div class="notes">

If you reuse good code you can be more productive.

GitHub and R packages can help you do that.

</div>



# Motivation



## Is most research actually reproducible? Why?

```{r error-field-guide}
knitr::include_graphics("error.png")
```

[Improve the system](http://jamesclear.com/goals-systems)



## What is the benefit of a good system?

```{r design-behaviour, out.width="45%", fig.show='hold'}
knitr::include_graphics("behavioural_architect_bad.jpg")
knitr::include_graphics("behavioural_architect_good.jpg")
```

## You should fall effortlessly into the pit of success

## __GitHub & R__ help us reuse good code

### ___The single biggest way to improve both the quality of your code and your productivity is to reuse good code.___

GitHub: is a place for the code to live and evolve
R Packages: 

- GitHub: Code repository and forum

A structure that makes using  the code easy

- R packages: __forestr__ and friends

<div class="notes">

What are research projects like?

- complex, 

- involve multiple collaborators,

- variable.

What changes? -> What do you need?

- the data and meta-data -> to track changes/versions;

- access privilege -> to control the level of access that people have

Set priorities

- tell me what you actually use

improve what we have

- documentation
- tests
- tutorials
- refactor

add what you have

create what we lack


















where we are heading

- we need better documentation
- more tests
- list priorities
- new code

how to contribute
