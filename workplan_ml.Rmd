```{r removeSlideNumbers, include=FALSE}
# From https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/issues/244
# To remove slide numbers to one of two things:

# One: Place this under the yamal header of the .Rmd file

# <style type="text/css">
# slides > slide:not(.nobackground):after {
#   content: '';
# }
# </style>



# Or, two: Place this in a separate mystyle.css file (remove <style> tag)

# slides > slide:not(.nobackground):after {
#   content: '';

# For approach two, the yamal header should look like this:

# need to set fig.width to 4.3 (6 * 0.5 / 0.7).

# Discussion Task by Task





## Excluded functions of priority c

```{r}
functions_priority %>% 
  filter(priority %in% c("c")) %>% 
  pull(fun) %>% 
  paste(collapse = ", ")
```

## Excluded functions of priority d

```{r}
functions_priority %>% 
  filter(priority %in% c("d")) %>% 
  pull(fun) %>% 
  paste(collapse = ", ")
```






# Main Goals

## update the package.

1. update the package.
    1. curate: decide what functions are useful and worthwhile keeping. DONE
    1. document: improve help files.
        1. titles, description and details.
        1. argumets (reuse templates)
        1. authors
        1. group related functions in one place
        1. add examples
        1. build a website
    1. validate: validate inputs or warn and err accoridingly. This helps users
       to understand what went wrong.
    1. test: This helps developers to notice that something  went wrong so they 
       can promptly fix it.
        1. regression tests: check old and new versions of a function outut the
           same.
        1. test that functions do what they are expected to do.
        1. checks: devtools::check()
        1. __lintr__ to check for style
        1. __goodpractice::gp()__ to check for general good practices
        1. TravisCI to check package builds on all platforms.
    1. refactor: re-write code to improve it. E.g.
        1. names: make them more elocuent, consistent
        1. arguments: 
            1. name arguments more elocuently
            1. order arguments more sensibly (data, details)
            1. give arguments most common or safest defaults
        1. code: 
            1. improve style for better readability and consistency with modern
               style guides.
            1. improve safety
            1. reduce complexity
                1. reduce nestedness (mostly unnecessary _if_ blocks)
                1. remove the boilperate code of `for` loops by replaceing `for`
                   loops by functional programming approaches (most generally,
                   calls  to `lapply(X, FUN)`)
            1. improve clarity



## optimize the package.

    1. Human brain(human brain): make useful code easier to find and use.
        1. naming functions better.
        1. grouping functions coherently.
        1. writting more complete and clearer documentation (goepen)
        1. facilitating access to documentation via websites
        1. announcing advances on twitter, workshops
        1. facilitating disussions on GitHub
        1. building capacity via code reviews, workshops, seminars, tutorials.
    1. Access to data:
        1. provide easy access to data for examples (__bci__, __bciex__).
        1. help the community to develop their own data packages.
        1. help the community to develop a friction-less workflow
    1. Code speed
        1. provide light data for examples and tests to run fast (__bciex__) 
        1. identify speed bottlenecks (__profviz__)
        1. replace slow by fast code. E.g. compare __base__ vs. __dplyr__ vs.
           __data.table__

## establish a framework for future maintenance and expansion.

    1. build R packages _sensu stricto__
    1. create platforms for:
        1. github.com/forestgeo:
            1. hosting code repositories, packages and package websites
            1. discussing current issues, proposed changes, collaboration, etc.
            1. managing collaboration
        1. (rpubs.com/forestgeo): publishing R products publicly
        1. bookdown.com/forestgeoguest: publishing R products 
           with privileges control
        1. @forestgeo, #forestgeo, #forestr, etc.: announcing developments.

## Comments about TASKS

Catagories

(1) Produce and maintain a package sensu stricto

Optimization and expantion is important but some updates come first (documentation, assertions, tests)


(4) Optimize code for speed.

If time allows, do this towards the end of the first period


(7) Write new functions to help in the pre-processing and formatting of CTFS-ForestGEO data. 

Assuming these functions are the ones that Suzanne shared with me, i.e. those which purpose is to produce r-tables from database data (__rtbl__)

Probabbly after releasing some module of __forestr__, e.g. after releasing abundance. If so, I may work on __rtbl__ during October and hav it finished by the end of October.
