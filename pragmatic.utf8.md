## What are your pragmatic solutions?

## Outline

- Part 1: From principles to actions

    - where to aim philosophically

    - how to get there

- Brake

- Part 2: Applications in research

    - how this principles and models fit our work

- Questions and answers

# From principles to actions

### Where to aim.

- Principles are guiding propositions, not rules.

## Do you think beyond the immediate problem?

Pragmatic people solve problems with special

- **attitude**, 

- **style**, 

- **philosophy.**

## Do you improve continuously?

![](kaizen.png)

### Japanese business philosophy of continuous improvement of working practices & personal efficiency.

## Do you stop decay as early as possible?

### **Don't leave broken windws!**

### [_Neglect accelerates the rot faster than any other factor_.](http://www.artima.com/intv/fixit.html)

# How to actually get there

- Examples illustrate principles, they are not recipes

## Invest in future-you

### **If it's cost-effective, Don't Repeat Yourself** ([DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself))

Example: use email's [search operators](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7190?hl=en) and save ([bookmarks](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5fCyFlg2t4pcDlIVHg5VlJZdkE)).

## Document WHY you do things

### **WHAT may be obvious, WHY is not.**

- Tell computers WHAT to do

- Tell humans WHY to do it

Most frequently, **the human you work for** is future you.

### **If (only if) it's worthwhile, program**

- If a process will likely recur, consider programming it,

- If the time spent to program that process is shorter than the accumulated time the program will eventually save you, **then program it**.

## Architect your behaviour

- [Behaviour can be designed](http://www.nirandfar.com/) (e.g. google, email, facebook)

- [Your environment strongly impacts your behaviour](http://jamesclear.com/habits-visibility-method).

## What old habit can you link a new habit to?

Focus on [systems, not goals](http://jamesclear.com/goals-systems)

_We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit_ (Aristotle).

# Brake

### Tell me your pragmatic story

# Part 2: Applications in research

## [The 5 steps of the creative process](http://jamesclear.com/five-step-creative-process)

### How the 5 steps model fits your work?

1. **gather material**, 
2. **work intensely** over the material in your mind,
3. **step away** from the problem, 
4. **LET THE IDEA RETURN NATURALLY**,
5. **test and adjust** your idea based on feedback.

Tip: [Manage your energy, not your time](http://jamesclear.com/productivity)

See how [Hadley Wickham](https://www.quora.com/How-is-Hadley-Wickham-able-to-contribute-so-much-to-R-particularly-in-the-form-of-packages) does it.

## Let the idea return naturally

### **This is when I said _eureka!_ over the past few days**

- Start with the ear muffs' story: sleeping
- Show the structure of a story: riding my scooter
- Spiral: doing push-ups
- Ask audience to share their pragmatic stories: morning shower

## The progress we fell, want and achieve

## Wrap up

### Part 1

- Think beyond the immediate problem; improve continuously; don't neglect.

- Invest in future-you; if it is cost-effective, DRY.

- Architect your behaviour; focus on systems (not goals).

## Wrap up

### Part 2

- Creativity is an iterative process; it feels circular but we do move forward (in a spiral).

- Plan creative work around your energy.

- There are lots of resources for useful principles and tools

## Where to go from here

# People's feedback

## 2017-01-17, Julia Schuckel

(Postdoctoral fellow, Lunds Universitet)

"I liked your talk a lot. It kept me engaged the full time. The fact that you gave inside into your personal strategies instead of just talking about theories was really refreshing. And also brave!"

"It inspired me to think about new strategies for myself, and am still thinking about it this evening. So, well done! It was really cool to have had the time to hear from people about their pragmatic solutions, but maybe it’s too much for an hour long talk and you could make a workshop out of it one day :)".

## 2017-01-17, Julia Schuckel (continued)

"In the interest of saving time, you could just talk anecdotally about some of the approaches that people shared today. It's definitely nice to infuse the talk with examples other than yours.  But of course that’s really just a matter of personal style. The part with the email organizing was new to me and a very good idea, but could be a bit more dense, you repeated yourself a little bit there. You probably shorten it automatically next time you speak.
I struggle finding something that I didn’t like!"
