## What makes pragmatic people special?

_[to approach] problems and their solutions._

_They **THINK BEYOND THE IMMADIATE PROBLEM**, always trying to place it in its larger context ..._

## DISCUSS

### How do you check emails?

- Who thinks that checking emails is one of the most **frequent** actions of the day?

- Who has systematically programmed the process they use to check emails?

## Outline

### Goal: to understand and practice pragmatic approaches

- Learn key principles, i.e. guiding propositions (not rules)

- Provide examples (not recipes)

### Part 1: from principles to actions

- The DRY principle

```R
- Demonstrate the DRY principle by my solution to checking emails

    - share links to solution so that everyone can do it

- formally present the DRY principle: what processess should we program?
    - processes that occurr twice will likely recur; consider those.
    - if the cost of programming those process is lower than the cummulative cost of run the processes without a program, then program those processes.
```

- Behavioural architecture

```R
- defaults
- we are lazy as electricity
    - tools close to where you need them
    - organize by frequency of usage (compare organizing clothes)

```

- Work plan

- Conclusion from part 1

```R
- Embrace pragmatism (DRY principle)
- Architect your behaviour (focus on processes)
- Work around energy
```

### Brake

- Recap from part 1

### Part 2: Ideas in action

- The 5 steps of the creative process

```R
## The 5 steps of the creative process

1. **gather material**, 
2. **work intensely** over the material in your mind,
3. **step away** from the problem, 
4. **LET THE IDEA RETURN NATURALLY**,
5. **test and adjust** your idea based on feedback.

> There is no such a thing as failure, only feedback.

--[Nicholar Boothman](http://nicholasboothman.com/)

```

## DISCUSS

### Where and when your everyday work fits in those 5 steps of the creative process?

| Step | time | work |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1-5 | xxx | xxx |

1. **Gather material**, 
2. **work intensely**,
3. **step away**,
4. **Let the idea return naturally**,
5. **test and adjust**.

## Example: my work fit into those 5 steps

| where | when | what |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1, 2 | day/night before | write `(a)`, analyse, ..., park downhill `(b)` |
| 3, 4 | brakes spread along each day | sleep, shower, run, cook, read | 
| 5 `(c)` | earlier sessions | re-write, re-analyse, ..., park downhill |

--

`(a)` "If you think without writing, you only think you're thinking" (Leslie Lamport).

`(b)` Idea from [Turbocharge your writting](http://www.nature.com/naturejobs/2011/110707/pdf/nj7354-129a.pdf)

`(c)` Note that step 5 is not an exact repetition of 1 and 2 because it starts from a point ahead. The creative process is iterative but eliptic, not circular.

RESEARCH'S DAILY CYCLE

(maybe choose different names)

What tasks go where in your day? 

(conceptual)

- Inspire

- Design

- Build

Tasks, tools, tricks

(practical)

Resources/tools

> In preparing for battle, I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable.
--General Dwight D. Eisenhower

 - to plan and stick to plan (xxxref JC)
      (plans are useless, but planning is essencial)
    - todo list
    - prioritize (xxxref JC)
    - avoid procrastination (xxxref JC)
    - develop healthy habits and stick to them, (xxxJC, Quote Aristotele)
    - manage time in short chunks (pomodoro clock)





- write
    - Turbocharge your writing (techniques)
    - R markdowns (tool); good entry door to R

- to edit
    - Geopen, a paper, super short
    - Style, a book, long but great!

- analyse
    - R
    - R tidyverse
    - R packages + GitHub + pkgdown
    - R markdown documents and notebooks

- capture ideas
    - GitHub Gist
    - GitstBox
    - GistBox Clipper

- develop (and share) ideas
    - GitHub repositories, issues/pull requests

- communicate ideas
    (social considerations)
    - Getting more
    - Convince them in 90 seconds  
> I suppose leadership at one time meant muscles; but today it means **getting along with people**.
--Gandhi  
    (tools)
    - R markdown isoslides
    - Online publishing: Rpubs, bookdown, github



- manage admin (emails, desktop workflow)
    + gmail tools
- collaborate







## [Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself)

We are all programmers. 

[Pragmatic programmers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer) follow the **DRY** principle.

_Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system_

--Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas 

## How to program

- Tell a computer WHAT to do

- remind humans (including future you) WHY

WHAT may be obvious, WHY is not.

## Let's program together

Develop a pragmatic approach to check today's emails.

It has to be clear enough, a no brainer. We should be able to do it without thinking, just by following instructions.

## more

Research is at times:
 
    - (+) creative thus exciting, 
    - (-) repetitive thus boring.

(Officially, roles commonly include: investigating, teaching, administration.)

How to get most out of our day?

(So the boring repetitive bit doesn't overtake the exciting creative bit)

Understand how the creative process works and plan our work around energy levels.

## Emails

## Search emails (e.g. gmail)

Find emails efficiently with [search operators](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7190?hl=en), e.g.:
(Play with the operators to decide how trustworthy they are. They improve with training)

    - UNREAD TODAY: is:unread newer_than:1d
    - OLD HEAVY EMAILS: larger:3M older_than:1y

Bookmark your common searches, or add Quick Links: 

Gear > Settings > Labs > Quick Links > enable > Save Changes

## Lost emails?

If you don't find what you are looking for, read messages: 

- _Some messages in Trash or Spam match your search. **View messages**_.
- _Improve result with **search options** such as sender, date, size and more._

## Organize emails

- Star emails
- Save star search in Quick Links

## Undo send

Gear > Settings > Enable Undo Send

## Plan

Todo list

How to manage time effectively, and in general how to devlop healthy habits. (James Clear)

Quote Aristotele

- prioritize
- avoid procrastination

## Write

Geopen, a paper, super short

Style, a book, long but great!

## Capture ideas

- GitHub Gist (share optionally)
- GistBox, comlement to enable search of private gists
- GistBox Clipper, complement to create gists from any page

## Develop ideas (share optionally)

GitHub repositories

- ilimited public repos

Researchers

- get 5 private repos free
- get 20 organization repos free

In each repo, use

- Issues
- Pull requests

## Communicate, get along with people

(recycle slides interviews)

- Getting more
- Convince them in 90 seconds

## Wrap up

Show links between data, projects, analysis, emails, issues, gists, ...
