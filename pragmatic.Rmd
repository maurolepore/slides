## What makes pragmatic people special?

_They **THINK BEYOND THE IMMADIATE PROBLEM**, always trying to place it in its larger context ..._

## Don't leave broken windows

Because "neglect accelerates the rot faster than any other factor."

## DISCUSS

### How do you check emails?

- Who thinks that checking emails is one of the most **frequent** actions of the day?

- Who has systematically programmed the process they use to check emails?

## Outline

### Goal: to understand and practice pragmatic approaches

- Learn key principles, i.e. guiding propositions (not rules)

- Provide examples (not recipes)

### Part 1: from principles to actions

```R
- Demonstrate the DRY principle by my solution to checking emails

    - share links to solution so that everyone can do it

- formally present the DRY principle: what processess should we program?
    - processes that occurr twice will likely recur; consider those.
    - if the cost of programming those process is lower than the cummulative cost of run the processes without a program, then program those processes.
```


- The [DRY principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself) (Don't Repeat Yourself

_Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system_

--Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas 

## How to program well

- Tell a computer WHAT to do

- Tell humans (including future you) WHY to do it

WHAT may be obvious, WHY is not.

- Behavioural architecture

```R
- defaults
- we are lazy as electricity
    - tools close to where you need them
    - organize by frequency of usage (compare organizing clothes)

```

- Work plan

- Conclusion from part 1

```R
- Embrace pragmatism (DRY principle)
- Architect your behaviour (focus on processes)
- Work around energy
```

## When (not) to program

If a process will recur, consider programming it,

If the time spent to program that process is shorter than the accumulated time the program saves, then programm it.

### Brake

- Recap from part 1

### Part 2: Ideas in action

- The 5 steps of the creative process

```R
## The 5 steps of the creative process

1. **gather material**, 
2. **work intensely** over the material in your mind,
3. **step away** from the problem, 
4. **LET THE IDEA RETURN NATURALLY**,
5. **test and adjust** your idea based on feedback.

> There is no such a thing as failure, only feedback.

## DISCUSS

### Where and when your everyday work fits in those 5 steps of the creative process?

| Step | time | work |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1-5 | xxx | xxx |

1. **Gather material**, 
2. **work intensely**,
3. **step away**,
4. **Let the idea return naturally**,
5. **test and adjust**.

## My example ([plan around energy](http://jamesclear.com/productivity))

| where | when | what |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1, 2 | day/night before | write `(a)`, analyse, ..., park downhill `(b)` |
| 3, 4 | brakes spread along each day | sleep, shower, run, cook, read | 
| 5 `(c)` | earlier sessions | re-write, re-analyse, ..., park downhill |

`(a)` "If you think without writing, you only think you're thinking" (Leslie Lamport).

`(b)` Idea from [Turbocharge your writting](http://www.nature.com/naturejobs/2011/110707/pdf/nj7354-129a.pdf)

`(c)` Note that step 5 is not an exact repetition of 1 and 2 because it starts from a point ahead. The creative process is iterative but eliptic, not circular.
