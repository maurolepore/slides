## Who would like to ...

- waste less time doing repetitive jobs (e.g.checking email)?

- eat healthier OR excercise more OR drink less?

- be more creative?

- get more done at the end of each day?

### Knowing few simple principles can help


## Outline

### Part 1: From principles to actions

#### Goal 1.1: To learn where to aim.

- Think beyond the immediate problem

    - Improve continuously: kai·zen
    - Stop decay ASAP: don't leave broken windows

#### Goal 1.2: To learn how to actually get there

- Invest in future you (i.e. stop procrastination)

    - Don't repeat yourself
    - Document WHY you do things

- Architect your behaviour

- Focus on systems, not goals

## Outline (continued)

### Brake

- Don't leave broken windows

### Part 2: Applications in research

#### Goal 2: See how this principles and models fit our work

- The 5 steps of the creative process

- How the 5 steps model fits our work

- Source of useful principles and tools

- Wrap up / questions and answers

# Part 1: From principles to actions

### Goal 1.1: To learn where to aim.

- Principles are guiding propositions, not rules.

## Think beyond the immediate problem

Place the problem in its larger context.

<div class="columns-2">

Pragmatic people approach problems and solutions with special

- **attitude**
- **style**
- **philosophy**

```{r, out.width="50%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("pragmatic_programmer_cover.jpg")
```

</div>

## Improve continuously; stop decay

<div class="columns-2">

### **kai·zen** /kīzən/ (noun) Japanese business philosophy of continuous improvement of working practices, personal efficiency, etc.

# Part 1: From principles to actions

### Goal 1.2: To learn how to actually get there

- Examples illustrate principles, they are not recipes

### Invest in future-you ([guide to stop procrasting](http://jamesclear.com/procrastination))


## Don't Repeat Yourself ([DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself))

Example: use email's [search operators](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7190?hl=en) and save ([bookmarks](https://goo.gl/9Ev0O1)).

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("check_email.png")
```

## Document WHY you do things

- Tell computers WHAT to do

- Tell humans `(*)` WHY to do it

WHAT may be obvious, WHY is not.

`(*)` Most frequently the human you work for is future you.


### If (only if) it's worthwhile, program

- If a process will likely recur, consider programming it,

- If the time spent to program that process is shorter than the accumulated time the program will eventually save you, **then programm it**.

## Architect your behaviour

- [Behaviour can be designed](http://www.nirandfar.com/) (e.g. google, email, facebook)

- [Your environment strongly impacts your behaviour](http://jamesclear.com/habits-visibility-method). 

- Architect your environment to favor actions you want to take.

For example:

I want to learn this material, so I made it my job to teach it.

--

_If you want to learn, teach_

--Ciceron (106 AC-43 AC)

## Focus on [systems, not goals](http://jamesclear.com/goals-systems)

_It’s Not the Event, It’s the Process._

--[James Clear](http://jamesclear.com/stay-focused)

_We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit._

-- Aristotle

## Recap part 1

We learned principles to know where to aim and how to get there

- Think beyond the immediate problem

    - Improve continuously (kai·zen)
    - Don't neglect (or rot will accelerate)

- Invest in future-you

    - If it is cost-effective, avoid repetition
    - Remind yourself WHY you do things

- Architect your behaviour

- To achieve more, focus on systems (not goals)

# Part 2: Applications in research

## [The 5 steps of the creative process](http://jamesclear.com/five-step-creative-process)

1. **gather material**, 
2. **work intensely** over the material in your mind,
3. **step away** from the problem, 
4. **LET THE IDEA RETURN NATURALLY**,
5. **test and adjust** your idea based on feedback.

_There is no such a thing as failure, only feedback._

--[Nicholar Boothman](http://nicholasboothman.com/)

## The progress we fell, want and achieve

## How the 5 steps model fits your work?

| Step | time | work |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1-5 | xxx | xxx |
| ... | xxx | xxx |
| 5 | xxx | xxx |

1. **Gather material**, 
2. **work intensely**,
3. **step away**,
4. **Let the idea return naturally**,
5. **test and adjust**.

Tip: [Manage your energy, not your time](http://jamesclear.com/productivity)

## How the 5 steps model fits my work?

| where | when | what |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1, 2 | day/night before | write `(a)`, analyse, ..., park downhill `(b)` |
| 3, 4 | brakes spread along each day | sleep, shower, run, cook, read | 
| 5 `(c)` | earlier sessions | re-write, re-analyse, ..., park downhill |

--

`(a)` _If you think without writing, you only think you're thinking_ (Leslie Lamport).

`(b)` Idea from [Turbocharge your writting](http://www.nature.com/naturejobs/2011/110707/pdf/nj7354-129a.pdf)

`(c)` Note that step 5 is not an exact repetition of 1 and 2 because it starts from a point ahead. The creative process is an iterative spiral.

## Recap part 2

We learned how some useful principles apply to research

- Creativity is a systematic and iterative process

- Progress may feel circular but we move forward in a spiral

- Plan the process of your creative work around your energy

- There are lots of resources for useful principles and tools
