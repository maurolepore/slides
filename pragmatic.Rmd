## To communicate effectively, tell a story

(Facts alone are not persuasive enough)

- [POINT] A pragmatic solution saved my PhD and a personal relationship.

- [WHEN] Two years ago; [WHO] My partner, my PhD and I; [WHERE] Australia.

- [PROBLEM] My partner unintentionally interrupted my work.

- [1-2 FAILED ATTEMPTS] (1) Asked to not interrupt; (2) Moved elsewhere.

- [SOLUTION] Buy a pair of bright ear-muffs!

- [PLACE THE POINT IN THE BIGGER PICTURE] A pragmatic approach to solving problems can improve anyone's work and life.

## Outline

- Part 1: From principles to actions

    - Goal 1: To learn where to aim philosophically

    - Goal 2: To learn how to actually get there

- Brake

- Part 2: Applications in research

    - Goal 3: See how this principles and models fit our work

- Questions and answers

# Part 1: From principles to actions

### Goal 1: To learn where to aim.

- Principles are guiding propositions, not rules.

## Think beyond the immediate problem

Place the problem in its larger context.

<div class="columns-2">

Pragmatic people approach problems and solutions with special

- **attitude**
- **style**
- **philosophy**

## Improve continuously; stop decay

<div class="columns-2">

### **kai·zen** /kīzən/ (noun) Japanese business philosophy of continuous improvement of working practices, personal efficiency, etc.

# Part 1: From principles to actions

### Goal 2: To learn how to actually get there

- Examples illustrate principles, they are not recipes

### Invest in future-you ([guide to stop procrastinating](http://jamesclear.com/procrastination))


## Don't Repeat Yourself ([DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself))

Example: use email's [search operators](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7190?hl=en) and save ([bookmarks](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5fCyFlg2t4pcDlIVHg5VlJZdkE)).

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("check_email.png")
```

## Document WHY you do things

### **WHAT may be obvious, WHY is not.**

- Tell computers WHAT to do

- Tell humans WHY to do it

Most frequently, **the human you work for** is future you.

### **If (only if) it's worthwhile, program**

- If a process will likely recur, consider programming it,

- If the time spent to program that process is shorter than the accumulated time the program will eventually save you, **then program it**.

## Architect your behaviour

- [Behaviour can be designed](http://www.nirandfar.com/) (e.g. google, email, facebook)

- [Your environment strongly impacts your behaviour](http://jamesclear.com/habits-visibility-method). 

```{r, out.width="50%", fig.show='hold'}

knitr::include_graphics("behavioural_architect_good.jpg")
```

## Focus on [systems, not goals](http://jamesclear.com/goals-systems)

_We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit._

-- Aristotle

_It’s Not the Event, It’s the Process._

--James Clear ([stay focused](http://jamesclear.com/stay-focused))


# Brake

### Tell me your pragmatic story

# Part 2: Applications in research

## [The 5 steps of the creative process](http://jamesclear.com/five-step-creative-process)

### How the 5 steps model fits your work?

1. **gather material**, 
2. **work intensely** over the material in your mind,
3. **step away** from the problem, 
4. **LET THE IDEA RETURN NATURALLY**,
5. **test and adjust** your idea based on feedback.

Tip: [Manage your energy, not your time](http://jamesclear.com/productivity)

See how [Hadley Wickham](https://www.quora.com/How-is-Hadley-Wickham-able-to-contribute-so-much-to-R-particularly-in-the-form-of-packages) does it.

## Let the idea return naturally

### **This is when I said _eureka!_ over the past few days**

- Start with the ear muffs' story: sleeping
- Show the structure of a story: riding my scooter
- Spiral: doing push-ups
- Ask audience to share their pragmatic stories: morning shower

## Wrap up

### Part 1

- Think beyond the immediate problem; improve continuously; don't neglect.

- Invest in future-you; if it is cost-effective, DRY.

- Architect your behaviour; focus on systems (not goals).

## Wrap up

### Part 2

- Creativity is an iterative process; it feels circular but we do move forward (in a spiral).

- Plan creative work around your energy.

- There are lots of resources for useful principles and tools
