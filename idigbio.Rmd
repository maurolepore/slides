```{r removeSlideNumbers, include=FALSE}
# From https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/issues/244
# To remove slide numbers to one of two things:

# One: Place this under the yamal header of the .Rmd file

# <style type="text/css">
# slides > slide:not(.nobackground):after {
#   content: '';
# }
# </style>



# Or, two: Place this in a separate mystyle.css file (remove <style> tag)

# slides > slide:not(.nobackground):after {
#   content: '';
# }

# For approach two, the yamal header should look like this:
# ---
# output:
#   ioslides_presentation:
    # css: mystyles.css

  )
# If you want to make sure the font size is consistent across all your figures,
# whenever you set out.width, you’ll also need to adjust fig.width to maintain
# the same ratio with your default out.width. For example, if your default
# fig.width is 6 and out.width is 0.7, when you set out.width = "50%" you’ll
# need to set fig.width to 4.3 (6 * 0.5 / 0.7).

<div class="notes">

Paleontologists and other researchers need to manage and share data, and this is challenging because research projects are generally complex and dynamic. To face that challenge, one particularly useful tools is GitHub.

Have any of you heard of GitHub before? And used it?

</div>

## Further your research with GitHub

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("git.png")
```

Linus Torvalds created Git, with a user-unfriendly interphase (from [Git for Humans](https://speakerdeck.com/alicebartlett/git-for-humans), Alice Bartlett)

<div class="notes">

GitHub is like a car with an engine. The engine of GitHub is called Git. 

But I won't tell you about the engine but about the whole car. Because you can drive a car around the world knowing close to nothing about its engine.

This is good news, because engines, including Git, are OK for mechanics but generally unfriendly to the user. 

So this talk about how to use GitHub as a vehicle to take your research further.

What are research projects like?

- complex, 

- involve multiple collaborators,

- variable.

What changes? -> What do you need?

- the data and meta-data -> to track changes/versions;

- access privilege -> to control the level of access that people have

</div>

## Is your system error prone?

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("error.png")
```

<div class="notes">

We don't get as much as we could from the data. Worse, data may be risked or unshared and research slowed.

## How much structure can I handle with GitHub?

## How I manage privileges among collaborators?

### Collaborators

- users
- teams of users

### Privileges

- admin
- write
- read
- none

### Protection

specific project branches
