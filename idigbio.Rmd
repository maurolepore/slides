```{r removeSlideNumbers, include=FALSE}
# From https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/issues/244
# To remove slide numbers to one of two things:

# One: Place this under the yamal header of the .Rmd file

# <style type="text/css">
# slides > slide:not(.nobackground):after {
#   content: '';
# }
# </style>



# Or, two: Place this in a separate mystyle.css file (remove <style> tag)

# slides > slide:not(.nobackground):after {
#   content: '';
# }

# For approach two, the yamal header should look like this:
# ---
# output:
#   ioslides_presentation:
    # css: mystyles.css
# ---
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# knitr ----
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  comment = "#>",

  fig.align = "center",
  fig.asp = 0.618,
  fig.width = 6,
  out.width = "75%",
  cache = TRUE,
  echo = FALSE 
  )
# If you want to make sure the font size is consistent across all your figures,
# whenever you set out.width, you’ll also need to adjust fig.width to maintain
# the same ratio with your default out.width. For example, if your default
# fig.width is 6 and out.width is 0.7, when you set out.width = "50%" you’ll
# need to set fig.width to 4.3 (6 * 0.5 / 0.7).

## Hit audience

The pit of success! Hadley

- pose question I want the audience to ask

Who ever heard of GitHub?
Who ever used GitHub?
Who regularly uses it?
Same for R packages?

Paleontologists...

When a friend asks you how to get to your place from work you tell her the way it works, not the many ways you tried before you discovered the best one. The same goes for the papers we write. We write the story of the project in a linear manner. That's what the readers expect, and that's what you give them. But the creative process is different, it is not linear.

## Is research like the black line only? | Or like the other mess too?

In 2001, when I started my PhD, I had never heard GitHub, or R.

I was told it could help me, but I couldn't see how because the examples were so foreingn to my paleontological research.

The first time I tried R was horrible, the second too and many more.

Then I helped

...

Today, I am a software developer for ForestGEO, I write computer programs that help researchers to their research. ...

The point, I'm here to show you that GitHub can help you because it helped me.

   - not because I come from computer science and know every software detail
   - because of the opposite
   - because like you, I am a paleo ecologyst, and know how hard it is to manage and share data, and know only the surface of computer science, but that's enough to improve how we do science by a lot

Scientists work hard but their impact is limited because they share we manage and share data poorly. There is a tool that datascientists use, but few of us use it because the applications are so different to what we do that we struggle to see how we would benefit. But the connection is direct. What is that tool?

Managing and sharing data is difficult because xxx, AND dropbox and google docs help to some extent. BUT xxxx, THEREFORE we need more to do good science...
What is that tool?

There is a tool, commonly used among data scientists, that helps researchers too.  
...
what is that tool?


## Outline (message box)

Issue: A framework for to manage and share data

Audience: Researchers (paleontologists)

Problem: Managing and sharing data is difficult because collaborative research requires

    - different levels of access, 
    - editing simultaneously,
    - versioning,
    - citing versions,

So what? We don't get as much as we could from the data. Worse, data may be risked or unshared and research slowed.

Solution: GitHub (and R). dropbox and google docs are too poorly featured, and databases are too complicated. GitHub fills the gap:

    - simple,
    - free,
    - fully featured and dynamically improved,
    - popular.

Benefit: We can manage and share data more efficiently.

# Opening

## From the know to the (maybe) unknown


# Solution (Action)

picture of f@#! Git

## What is GitHub

## Why is it useful?

## How can I use GitHub (to manage and share data)?

- Interface (Source tree, R...)

## If I use R packages, what else do I get from GitHub/R?

- Interface to GitHub (to commit, pull and push)

- Get data and documentation into R with `install_github()`

- Help to build and document the package via devtools and rogygen2

- Access data from many projects easily

- Privacy control

    - public or private repos
    - manage access of collaborators, teams
    - private source yet downloadable data via 

```
`install_github("<PACKAGE>", `auto_token`)
```

## Case study

- Organization (admin/member)
    - Teams (read/write)
        - Members
        - Collaborators (extra control layer)

- Branches (protected/not/who edits)

## Example

## Where can I learn more?







# Conclusion

**So what?**

We don't get as much as we could from the data. Worse, data may be risked or unshared and research slowed.

**Benefit**

We can manage data more safely with Git
We can share more effectively with GitHub
We can share and manage fluently with Git(Hub) and R

## Action

### How to do it

- show examples. maybe slides, live programming may be clunky

### Give and get

COSTS TO YOU 

* 2' to open account

* 10' hello world

* ...

BENEFITS TO YOU

* website for your projects

* time travel

* discussion platform optionally bypass emails

* true collaboration

* privacy

* whats's here? when last changed? who changed it? Why? Oh, I want that version! https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/happy-git-and-github-for-the-user


* diff https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/happy-git-and-github-for-the-user

* metadata is the data https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/happy-git-and-github-for-the-user
