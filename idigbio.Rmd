```{r removeSlideNumbers, include=FALSE}
# From https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/issues/244
# To remove slide numbers to one of two things:

# One: Place this under the yamal header of the .Rmd file

# <style type="text/css">
# slides > slide:not(.nobackground):after {
#   content: '';
# }
# </style>



# Or, two: Place this in a separate mystyle.css file (remove <style> tag)

# slides > slide:not(.nobackground):after {
#   content: '';
# }

# For approach two, the yamal header should look like this:
# ---
# output:
#   ioslides_presentation:
    # css: mystyles.css
# ---
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(

  fig.align = "center",

  fig.width = 6,
  out.width = "100%",
  cache = TRUE,
  echo = FALSE 
  )
# If you want to make sure the font size is consistent across all your figures,
# whenever you set out.width, you’ll also need to adjust fig.width to maintain
# the same ratio with your default out.width. For example, if your default
# fig.width is 6 and out.width is 0.7, when you set out.width = "50%" you’ll
# need to set fig.width to 4.3 (6 * 0.5 / 0.7).

# Manage and Share Data | Let GitHub and R help you

### [\@mauro_lepore](xxxlinktotwitter) 


<div class="notes">

Paleontologists and other researchers need to manage and share data, and this is challenging because research projects are generally complex and dynamic. To face that challenge, there is one particularly useful tools, GitHub.

Have any of you heard of GitHub before? And used it?

</div>

## Further your research with GitHub

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("git.png")
```

[Git for Humans](https://speakerdeck.com/alicebartlett/git-for-humans), Alice Bartlett.

<div class="notes">

GitHub is like a car with an engine. The engine of GitHub is called Git. 

But I won't tell you about the engine but about the whole car. Because you can drive a car around the world knowing close to nothing about its engine.

This is good news, because engines, including Git, are OK for mechanics but generally unfriendly to the user. 

So this talk about how to use GitHub as a vehicle to take your research further.

</div>

# Outline

### Define the problem we need to solve

### Argue that GitHub is one useful solution

### Show

## How do you manage and share data?

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("framework.png")
```

## What challenges research projects rise?

Linus Torvalds created Git (from [Git for Humans](https://speakerdeck.com/alicebartlett/git-for-humans), Alice Bartlett.

<div class="notes">

What are research projects like?

- complex, 

- involve multiple collaborators,

- variable.

What changes? -> What do you need?

- the data and meta-data -> to track changes/versions;

- access privilege -> to control the level of access that people have

</div>

## So what? | Do you get as much as possible and smoothly?

We don't get as much as we could from the data. Worse, data may be risked or unshared and research slowed. 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("error.png")
```

## Solution | What is your pit of success?

xxx image of the pit of success!

GitHub (and R)

Alternatives: dropbox and google docs are too poorly featured, and databases are too complicated. GitHub fills the gap:

    - simple,
    - free,
    - fully featured and dynamically improved,
    - popular.

## Benefit | How your system improves your science and life?

xxx image f#! you git

We can manage and share data more efficiently.







# GitHub: what, why, where and how

## What is GitHub

## Why is GitHub useful?

## How can I use GitHub?

- Interface (Source tree, R...)

## How can I use GitHub with R data-packages?

- Interface to GitHub (to commit, pull and push)

- Get data and documentation into R with `install_github()`

- Help to build and document the package via devtools and rogygen2

- Access data from many projects easily

- Privacy control

    - public or private repos
    - manage access of collaborators, teams
    - private source yet downloadable data via 

```
`install_github("<PACKAGE>", `auto_token`)
```

# Example

## GitHub structure

- Organization (admin/member)
    - Teams (read/write)
        - Members
        - Collaborators (extra control layer)

- Branches (protected/not/who edits)

# Conclusion

- Do you want to get more out of your data?

- Do you want to struggle less in the process?

### Have you tried GitHub?

# end

# Supplement

## Action

### How to do it

- show examples. maybe slides, live programming may be clunky

### Give and get

COSTS TO YOU 

* 2' to open account

* 10' hello world

* ...

BENEFITS TO YOU

* website for your projects

* time travel

* discussion platform optionally bypass emails

* true collaboration

* privacy

* whats's here? when last changed? who changed it? Why? Oh, I want that version! https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/happy-git-and-github-for-the-user


* diff https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/happy-git-and-github-for-the-user

* metadata is the data https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/happy-git-and-github-for-the-user
