```{r removeSlideNumbers, include=FALSE}
# From https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/issues/244
# To remove slide numbers to one of two things:

# One: Place this under the yamal header of the .Rmd file

# <style type="text/css">
# slides > slide:not(.nobackground):after {
#   content: '';
# }
# </style>



# Or, two: Place this in a separate mystyle.css file (remove <style> tag)

# slides > slide:not(.nobackground):after {
#   content: '';
# }

# For approach two, the yamal header should look like this:
# ---
# output:
#   ioslides_presentation:
    # css: mystyles.css
# ---
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

  fig.width = 6,
  out.width = "75%",
  cache = TRUE,
  echo = FALSE 
  )
# If you want to make sure the font size is consistent across all your figures,
# whenever you set out.width, you’ll also need to adjust fig.width to maintain
# the same ratio with your default out.width. For example, if your default
# fig.width is 6 and out.width is 0.7, when you set out.width = "50%" you’ll
# need to set fig.width to 4.3 (6 * 0.5 / 0.7).

- Anyone uses R packages regularly?

## F\@*# Git!

<div class="notes">

When I started my PhD in 2011, I had never heard GitHub or R. At a workshop, the teacher said these tools were critical for research, and he used them 100% of the time. But then I couldn't see how GitHub or R could help me, because the examples I saw were so foreingn to my own work.

Now, I also use GitHub and R 100% of the time! In this presentation, my goal is to show you how I use these tools to support a network of forest ecologysts, called FotestGEO.

# Outline

### Opening: issue, problem, so what?, solution, benefit

### GitHub: what, why, where and how

### Example

## Issue | Do you have a framework to manage and share data

- Ask what people use. Do they use GitHub? And R?

## Problem | What challenges you face to managing and sharing data?

![git branches](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5856545/24099946/2bf10d1a-0d48-11e7-8c29-8f868431ae3a.png)


What are research projects like?

- complex, 

- involve multiple collaborators,

- variable.

What changes? -> What do you need?

- the data and meta-data -> to track changes/versions;

- access privilege -> to control the level of access that people have

## So what? | Do you get as much as possible and smoothly?

We don't get as much as we could from the data. Worse, data may be risked or unshared and research slowed. 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("error.png")
```

## Solution | What is your pit of success?

xxx image of the pit of success!

GitHub (and R)

Alternatives: dropbox and google docs are too poorly featured, and databases are too complicated. GitHub fills the gap:

    - simple,
    - free,
    - fully featured and dynamically improved,
    - popular.

## Benefit | How your system improves your science and life?

We can manage and share data more efficiently.

# GitHub: what, why, where and how

## What is GitHub

## Why is GitHub useful?

## How can I use GitHub?

- Interface (Source tree, R...)

## How can I use GitHub with R data-packages?

- Interface to GitHub (to commit, pull and push)

- Get data and documentation into R with `install_github()`

- Help to build and document the package via devtools and rogygen2

- Access data from many projects easily

- Privacy control

    - public or private repos
    - manage access of collaborators, teams
    - private source yet downloadable data via 

```
`install_github("<PACKAGE>", `auto_token`)
```

# Example

## GitHub structure

- Organization (admin/member)
    - Teams (read/write)
        - Members
        - Collaborators (extra control layer)

- Branches (protected/not/who edits)

# Conclusion

- Do you want to get more out of your data?

- Do you want to struggle less in the process?

### Have you tried GitHub?

# end

# Supplement

## Action

### How to do it

- show examples. maybe slides, live programming may be clunky

### Give and get

COSTS TO YOU 

* 2' to open account

* 10' hello world

* ...

BENEFITS TO YOU

* website for your projects

* time travel

* discussion platform optionally bypass emails

* true collaboration

* privacy

* whats's here? when last changed? who changed it? Why? Oh, I want that version! https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/happy-git-and-github-for-the-user


* diff https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/happy-git-and-github-for-the-user

* metadata is the data https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/happy-git-and-github-for-the-user
