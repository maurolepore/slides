## Prove your skills and personality

Your interviewer seeks to answer two questions:

1. Do you have the skills we need?
2. Can we put up with you?

You most likely know how to prove 1. Here I focus on 2.

### Source of ideas

Books about connecting with people and persuading them:

-	[Getting more](https://gettingmore.com/)

-	**Convince them in 90 seconds** ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUQ1WkjsxSY): watch 1:35-4:00 sec)

## What connects you to them?

- third parties

- institutions

- communities

- cities

- hobbies

- family

- enemies

## Before you interview

Find out about

- the organization

- the interviewer


Answer

- What are their proffesional interests?

- What are their personal interests?

Personal interests help you to connect personally (so they like you more)


Check for example

- Professional and focused: websites, linkedin, 

- General: google, twitter, blogs

- Personal: facebook

Specifically, find interests that match. People like the alike.

Latter you can use this information 

Find what you have in common. Some information will help  you to connect personally. WARNING: don´t show you investigated personal information. 

It is ok to say that you looked them un in linkedin and maybe a professional facebook, but not a personal facebook.


## Find out about yourself

- How will the interviewer percieve you?

They may do the same you are doing. Great!

Based on what they know about you,  how will they perceive  you?

- Third  parties

- What will they say aboout  you? And how will  the interviewer take it based on their background (compare Asian, American, UK, German, etc.)

If you  have to defend yourself, prepare a strong and polite argument


- How will the interviewer percieve you?


What information are they going to have about you


What are they likely going to ask? Prepare answers

Prove what you claim you are

Justify your deficiencies.


## The day of the interview

## When you interview

## After you interview




### Deposit

### The day of the meeting

First impression
Dress mixing authority and approachability
Dress for your next job, not the one you have

### When meeting

They will ask themselves:
-	Do you have the skills I need
-	Can I put up with you?

Pick a helpful attitude not an unhelpful one and really “wear it”. Think of a time when you felt that emotion, and bring it back.

Pick a tone of voice that matches the attitude

Take a moment to see how they want to greet, (they may not shake hands)

Chit chat (prepare, common enemies, allies).

NLP
Mirror tone of voice, volume, movements, way of sitting. They won’t note.
Open your body and point your heart to the other person’s hart
Look straight into the eye and make an mental note about the colour of their eyes.
Remember the name (prepare, find who you will meet)

Think that a lot happens outside of the interview time.

Find third parties




Employer’s needs
Ask questions more than make statements, the helps understand needs
Reduce perceived risk
Look straight into the eye, note colour of eyes

### After the meeting
