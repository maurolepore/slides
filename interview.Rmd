### The day of the meeting

First impression
Dress mixing authority and approachability
Dress for your next job, not the one you have

### When meeting

They will ask themselves:
-	Do you have the skills I need
-	Can I put up with you?

Pick a helpful attitude not an unhelpful one and really “wear it”. Think of a time when you felt that emotion, and bring it back.

Pick a tone of voice that matches the attitude

Take a moment to see how they want to greet, (they may not shake hands)

Chit chat (prepare, common enemies, allies).

NLP
Mirror tone of voice, volume, movements, way of sitting. They won’t note.
Open your body and point your heart to the other person’s hart
Look straight into the eye and make an mental note about the colour of their eyes.
Remember the name (prepare, find who you will meet)

Think that a lot happens outside of the interview time.

Find third parties




Employer’s needs
