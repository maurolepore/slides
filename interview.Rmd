## Prove your skills and personality

Your interviewers seek to answer two questions (\*):

1. Do you have the skills we need?
2. Can we put up with you? Or better: **do we like you?**

You most likely know how to prove 1. Here I **focus** on 2.

(\*) In other words, [Can we respect (1) and trust (2) you?](http://www.businessinsider.com/harvard-psychologist-amy-cuddy-how-people-judge-you-2016-1)

## Source of ideas

Books about connecting with people and persuading them:

-	*Convince them in 90 seconds* ([watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUQ1WkjsxSY) from 1:35-4:00 sec)

# The interview



## Before:find connections

What connects you to them?

- friends, colleagues;

- institutions, communities;

- hobbies;

- life experiences (e.g. cities you lived, places you studied);

- something else?

Use e.g. google, linkedin, twitter, facebook

(It's OK to say you researched their profesional life, not their personal life--do it but don't say you did it).

## Find about yourself

What will they find about you if they look you up?

- I that what you want to show?

- Is there anything missing/innapropriate?

- Is there anything ?


What will your personal references or people in common tell them?

- how will the message depart from the source and arrive to your interviewer?

(E.g. a letter of refference written by an american vs. a german may be very different, and will tell different things to an american or a german reader.)

- is that fair? if not, prepare a polite defense

## Reduce percieved risk

A deal is more likely as it risk lowers

- What can you do to reduce the risk they perceive in hiring you?

    - prove skills based on past experience or a test
    - provide personal/professional refferences
    - be flexible to accept a casual contract
    - lower the salary
    - volunteer
    - anyting else

## What do they need?

Consider the job offer advertised.

What needs they have?

- one by one match the needs (role description) they have with the skills you have. Demonstrate them with examples. Lots of examples. Otherwise, they are empty claims. Think carefully. It is hard but the examples will come. It can be  compleately outside the role. 

E.g. prove leadership with an example where you led a soccer team.

xxxfind article in nature science  i read recently. about skills.

to your skills. 

What are they likely going to ask? Prepare answers

## After you interview

## The day of the meeting

First impression
Dress mixing authority and approachability
Dress for your next job, not the one you have

## When meeting

They will ask themselves:
-	Do you have the skills I need
-	Can I put up with you?

Pick a helpful attitude not an unhelpful one and really “wear it”. Think of a time when you felt that emotion, and bring it back.

Pick a tone of voice that matches the attitude

Take a moment to see how they want to greet, (they may not shake hands)

Chit chat (prepare, common enemies, allies).

NLP
Mirror tone of voice, volume, movements, way of sitting. They won’t note.
Open your body and point your heart to the other person’s hart
Look straight into the eye and make an mental note about the colour of their eyes.
Remember the name (prepare, find who you will meet)

Think that a lot happens outside of the interview time.

Find third parties




Employer’s needs
Ask questions more than make statements, the helps understand needs
Reduce perceived risk
Look straight into the eye, note colour of eyes

### After the meeting
